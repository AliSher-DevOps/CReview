# CReview
# Project
The CReview management system can be used to favour the android developers. CReview is a platform where android application developers get customer reviews perform sentimental analysis and generate auto-reply of those reviews in one platform. CReview management system dashboard shows graphs on the weekly basis of customer feedback response and this will help the developer to easily understand the issue, bugs, and success ratio of their application. This application shows a list of issues, which mainly face by the customer and using this application it, is easy for a developer to understand the problem

# Main Idea
CReview management system solves the android developer's problem of reviewing
customer's reviews from the play store and identifying the problem one by one. It also helps
the developer to understand what problems customers are facing while using the
developer's application and what issues customers face. We are developing this software to
reduced developer's time and provide the solution to all his problems in one platform. Some
software scraps the customer's reviews from all developer's consoles/accounts and displays
in one platform but none of them like the CReview management system, which scraps, and
analysis customer reviews and generate autoreply for them
